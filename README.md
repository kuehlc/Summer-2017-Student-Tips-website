# Summer-2017-Student-Tips-website
Summer (2017) Concept site for students to give tips to getting through classes they have already taken at a particular school.
This is an incomplete site. It was originally going to be a pet project to practice for my Advanced Web course coming up, but it turned out to be a bigger project than I expected and ran out of time.
